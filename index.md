## Aims:

In the era of “Industry 4.0”, Computational intelligence for industrial sustainability is considered at the forefront of the next generation industrial revolution and its classic methods, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, and evolutionary computing, have been used by researchers across multiple disciplinary fields. Also, a rising demand for intelligent design systems has been seen in the increased requirements of environmental resilience, modularity, mass customisation, flexibility, resource and ecological efficiency, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness of products and their manufacturing processes. This special session is important and timely to address this trending, by incorporating computational intelligence, design for sustainable manufacturing, life cycle engineering and low carbon manufacturing. The goal for this special session is to encourage discussion and multi-disciplinary knowledge exchange, call for papers reporting various applications of CI to industrial sustainability and related applications, and to collectively make a positive contribution to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG17).

## Scope:

The session aims to collect theoretical and empirical studies that contribute to developing a better understanding of industrial sustainable development and sustainability, taking into account the key development in computational intelligence, digital manufacturing, life cycle engineering, intelligent design systems and emerging opportunities towards industry 4.0. Potential topics of this special session include, but are not limited to:

- Computational Intelligence for manufacturing sustainability
- Low carbon manufacturing
- Industrial symbiosis for manufacturing
- Eco-efficient Manufacturing
- Sustainable value creation through industrial symbiosis
- Decision-making for manufacturing
- Remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling technologies
- Design for sustainable manufacturing
- Intelligent manufacturing resource planning
- Digital twins and Digital Manufacturing
- AI for Topology Optimisation
- Manufacturing Process Planning, Scheduling and Optimisation
